        <p>i <br> i want <br> i want to <br> i want to learn <br> i want to learn all of the things <br> <br> there's so much to learn <br> yet, we learn so little <br> <br> why is that the case of the world? <br> why is that? <br> why is? <br> why? <br> <br> technology is here, right? <br> right now. <br> so why don't we use it? <br> maybe for our benefit before it could be against us.</p>

        <p>a website is a website. <br> a website is a shelf.<br> a website is a puddle. <br>a website is a cloud. <br>a website is a plant. <br>a website is a home. <br>a website is a website is a website. <br>but, a website is a living room. <br>a website is a library. <br>a website is a history. <br>a website is a textbook. <br>a website is a system. <br>a website is a website is a website.</p>

        <p>handmade web tends to refer to web made by the hand. you know, something made at the hand of a person, and not a computer. <br> but, there is more depth to what handmade web actually is, than what meets the eye. here we are, in a world where we could go find the source code for any website out there.<br> i don’t think we realize how beneficial that actually is. who can say that they can learn coding this way. <br> coding is learning. handmade web is learning. learning by hand what goes into these websites. the effort. the specificity. <br> that will teach us more than anything that we could learn from the internet. it’s how you learn. it’s how you remember. the hand remembers so much.</p>

        <p> what stood out in this article to me wasn't actually about the specific content, but more so the structure.<br>every once in a while we got an interruption in the writing. where we got this personal element of the author. it is reminiscent of how computers and digital media is<br> usually, yes, they are made at the hands of a person, but when the personable elements are thrown in there, it is a nice reminder of the hand that goes into the work.<br> for example, our hand coding in this class. there is a hand behind every website, every decision, every structure. and sometimes we thrown little elements in there that add our "touch".</p>

        <p>everything has a reference. everything has a history. nothing was made from nothing. <br> the internet itself was inspired by something. everything on the internet has a history. <br> nothing is really "original" anymore. </p>
