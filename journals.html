        <p>i <br> i want <br> i want to <br> i want to learn <br> i want to learn all of the things <br> <br> there's so much to learn <br> yet, we learn so little <br> <br> why is that the case of the world? <br> why is that? <br> why is? <br> why? <br> <br> technology is here, right? <br> right now. <br> so why don't we use it? <br> maybe for our benefit before it could be against us.</p>

        <p>a website is a website. <br> a website is a shelf.<br> a website is a puddle. <br>a website is a cloud. <br>a website is a plant. <br>a website is a home. <br>a website is a website is a website. <br>but, a website is a living room. <br>a website is a library. <br>a website is a history. <br>a website is a textbook. <br>a website is a system. <br>a website is a website is a website.</p>

        <br>
        <p>handmade web tends to refer to web made by the hand. you know, something made at the hand of a person, and not a computer. <br> but, there is more depth to what handmade web actually is, than what meets the eye. here we are, in a world where we could go find the source code for any website out there.<br> i don’t think we realize how beneficial that actually is. who can say that they can learn coding this way. <br> coding is learning. handmade web is learning. learning by hand what goes into these websites. the effort. the specificity. <br> that will teach us more than anything that we could learn from the internet. it’s how you learn. it’s how you remember. the hand remembers so much.</p>
