                    <p id="text"> i woke up bright and early today (at 5:25) to go to the gym. ryan and ian were supposed to go with me, but ryan was too tired so it was just ian. he called me "bat shit crazy" for the sake that it was still dark out when we had to go. today i did arm day. usually fridays are core/cardio, but my gym schedule got very messed up this week. after the gym i got ready for class and met ian at abi's books and brews. i got a peppermint tea and he got a latte. then we picked up our friends on our "carpool" walk. we had synthesis at 9, and today we got donuts and gave presentations for the theme of our senior show. my group presented "condensed" although ours was not the winner. instead, "overbooked: the last dinner party" was chosen. i'm excited for that. after synthesis i had to go home and do a job interview for a graphic design internship. it was fine. then work time. i was working for 5 hours at the anderson today because i was covering the opening recpetion we had that night. it was the art ed and comm arts shows that were opening. pretty chill night. i didn't have anything better to do on valentine's day. once we got everything put away i went home and watched a movie with my roommate. tonight, we watched baby mama (2008) with tina fey and amy poehler (shoutout sisters if you know what i mean). had some black cherry wine during the movie too. pretty solid. i gave the movie 2.5/5 because i was fully expecting it to be shitty and it was actually a little bit better than expected. after that, it was time to lay in bed.
