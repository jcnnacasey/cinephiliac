                    <p id="text">today my day started off with deciding not to go to the gym. i was feeling pretty tired, so i chose the extra hour of sleep. therefore, i got up at 6:30 and took a shower, got dressed, and made breakfast. at 8 i had to get ready to leave for work. i work in snead hall for the risk management & insurance and the kornblau real estate programs. i worked there from 8:30-3:30pm this day. usually i get off at 1:30, but i was waiting for ryan to get off work to go to plaza together. at work i continued working on some projects i had been assigned last week. i also had to organize the office a little bit, along with packaging up/writing the shipping labels for multiple packages we had to send out. i ended my shift there with my boss giving me the sweetest little valentine's day gift. at 3:30 i left to meet ryan and we went to plaza. i needed to get some sharpies for my multi ii workshop that was supposed to occur on tuesday. i bought 4. then, ryan had ordered food and i was craving a milkshake, so i went to chicfila to get a milkshake. they didn't have milkshakes that day, though, so steak n shake it was. i got a vanilla for myself, and a chocolate for my sister. after ryan had his food we parted ways and i went to my sister's apartment with the milkshakes. once i finished mine i went back to my own apartment, but not until after i had terrorized her cats a little bit. in my apartment, i sat and stared at my phone for over an hour because i was sad it was dark out. i finally got up around 6:30 and made dinner, and convinced my roommate to watch a movie with me. we watched prisoners (2013). it was a first watch for both of us, and really really good. i gave it 4.5/5 stars on letterboxd. after the movie i laid in bed and i think i fell asleep around like 9:15.</p>
