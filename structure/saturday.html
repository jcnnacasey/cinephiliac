                    <p id="text"> i honestly can't even remember how this day started. oh, i just laid in bed until i had to get ready for work. on saturdays, i work 11:30-5:30 at the anderson, so that was where i was most of the day. i spent a majority of my shift working on the structure project. it took me like 3 different ideas before i settled on this one, and took me a long time to structure everything the way i wanted it. towards the end of my shift i started a task my boss had asked me to do while i was there. it was a task that was realistically easy in theory, but in practice it was a lot more complicated than met the eye. therefore,i only did it about halfway before my shift was over. it was so rainy today so i got wet on my way home (even with an umbrella). my sister and i went to short pump around 6:30 to go buy shoes. i needed shoes for a conference and she needed shoes for a wedding. we both found what we were looking for. then, we had to kill time until 8:30, as we were meeting our mom at the cheesecake factory for dinner. so, we went to barnes and noble to kill time because it is my sister's happy place. then it was dinner time, and we were hungry. overall, we got some apps, a meal, and dessert. cheesecake factory isn't my fave, but free food is free food. after dinner we headed home and i got in bed.
