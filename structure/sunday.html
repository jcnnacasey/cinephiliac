                    <p id="text"> today was pretty slow in the morning. i slept way later than i usually do. i knew i had a lot of work to get done today, but i didn't want to spend my whole day at the library. around 11 ryan and i mutually agreed we needed to get work done so we went to the library at noon. we stayed until 3:15 and i was able to get through a couple articles for my synthesis project. after the library i proceeded to work on synthesis until 7pm. at that point, it was dinner time and i made nachos with my chipotle bowl. i, again, convinced my roommate to watch a movie. the movie on the agenda for tonight was the wicker man (1973). it was weird tbh. i gave it 2.5/5. not really my type of movie. but my roommate told me that i NEEDED to watch midsommar asap now, since i haven't seen it yet. post-movie, it was bed time.
