                    <p id="text">i did not go to the gym this morning. boooooo. i was too tired the night before to have the effort to go this morning. instead, i slept until 6:30 and then showered, got dressed and ate breakfast before having to be at work at 8:30. however, when i woke up, my internet was out. so my apartment was really going through it these days. i had to give a student research presentation for the o&m today, but i was not able to do my notes for it until i arrived at the office. so i spent the first 30 minutes of my shift doing just this. my bosses were at an offsite meeting, so it was just me in the office until 11. i did not much this day because the tasks we had, i had questions about. therefore, i inventoried everything we had in one of our offices that needed to be cleaned, and finished that right before 11. i left right at 11:30 this day, so that i could eat before i had to be at the lecture hall at 12:15 to present. ryan met me for bleecker street at snead before we went. we were both giving presentations, for different reasons, but were equally nervous. however, it felt a lot better once it was actually time to present and i felt like i was worrying for nothing. although, it still was a lot of people to present in front of, but at least i was presenting with zach, so it wasn't just me alone. after the presentation i led a multi ii workshop with faith. we only had sophomores today, and they honestly really surprised us with what they did. our workshop was prompted drawings, so we gave them 6 prompts, and 5 minutes for each, to draw basically the first thing that came to their mind when they heard the phrase. then we discussed unconscious bias and why they drew what they did when they heard the phrase. it was overall a really good workshop. i'm excited for next week's workshops. then i got chipotle before web and had web class. ryan and i stay in pollak for web to stay focused during class. this class we were learning flexbox and ian said we needed to pay attention as it was very important. once class ended i went home and got in bed, and probably went to sleep 30 minutes later.
