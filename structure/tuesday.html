                        <p id="text"> today i woke up bright and early at 5:25. this is the time i have to wake up at to go to the gym. 6-7 i get a solid back day workout in before the snow was to come later in the day. this morning vcu went virtual for the day, so i got to work from home from 8:30-11:30 instead of going into the office. today, all i worked on when clocked in was redesigning my boss' study guide for his class. i did not finish lol. after work i convinced myself that i was going to be productive, and i was to some extent. i didn't get nearly as much done as i had wanted, but i was able to mockup a couple page layouts for the grant publication i am working on this semester. multi class was cancelled today because of vcu going virtual so i did have extra time to kill. before i knew it, it was time for web class. i joined that on zoom at 5:30 and during the class i presented my passion project. naturally, i had to promo the letterboxd account. after web i decided to go over to my sister's apartment and watch the wild robot (2024). that movie could fuck you up. either way, i gave it 5/5 stars. it was so cute. after that i went back to my apartment and got in bed. the only reason i had agreed to a movie after 8:30pm was because the gym wasn't opening until 9:30 on wednesday, so i did not have to get up at 5:25 to gym.
