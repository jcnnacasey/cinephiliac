                    <p id="text">i got to sleep a little later today. only until 7:30, but still, it's something. it had seemed like today would be more promising with vcu being open. i was going to have class at 10:30 in 822 on broad. then, my power went out around 9. vcu pushed back start of day to 11. then, they did it again. vcu went virtual. unfortunately, i still had class. it was meeting at 11, but on zoom. since i did not have power, i had to walk to a coffee shop that had power to do class. we met in our curatorial groups to finish up our presentations for friday. my group was doing the concept "condensed". after class, which ended at 1:20, i had to run home to eat lucnh before i had a meeting at 2:30 with zach and luiza for our grant publication. zach and i had to drive to blanchard's on broad to have the meeting, since, again, neither of us had power. after that meeting i went to my sisters apartment and we played a game with the little natural light we had. we couldn't do much else since we couldn't charge our devices. once my sister's husband got home, we went to the village for dinner, since they still had power. after dinner we killed time until 6:30 and decided we were going to go bowling. we still didn't have power and we didn't want to just sit in the dark. we only played 3 rounds of bowling because we had to switch lanes 3 times. the first time our lane kept getting stuck. then the lane ate all of our balls. naturally, we just gave up after that and went home because at 7 our power had come back on. once i was home from bowling around 9 i just went immediately to bed because i was emotionally and physically exhausted from that day.
